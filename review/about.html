                     <p style="color:white">Beta thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder in which the body doesn't make hemoglobin normally.
						 Hemoglobin is the part of red blood cells (RBCs) that carries oxygen throughout the body. The abnormal hemoglobin
						 can lead to anemia (not enough RBCs in the body) and other medical problems.Beta-thalassemia is caused by mutations
						 in the HBB gene which provides instructions for making a protein named betaglobin on chromosome 11, and is inherited
						 in an autosomal recessive fashion. It is estimated that the annual incidence of symptomatic beta-thalassemia individuals
						 worldwide is 1 in 100,000. According to medical research, betathalassemia can result in bone deformities, especially in the face.

                     <p style="color:white"> Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder caused by the
trisomy of chromosome 21. DS occurs in about one per one
thousand the newborns each year. The common symptoms
include physical growth delays, mild to moderate intellectual
disability, and the special face. The typical characteristics of
DS [15] on the face include large head compared to the face,
upward slant of palpebral fissures, flattened nasal bridge,
Brushfield spots, epicanthal fold, low-set, small, folded ears,
short, broad nose with depressed root and full tip, a small
oral cavity with broadened alveolar ridges and narrow palate,
small chin and short neck.
					 Down syndrome is a condition in which a person has an extra chromosome. Chromosomes are small “packages” of
						 genes in the body. They determine how a baby's body forms during pregnancy and how the baby's body functions
						 as it grows in the womb and after birth. Typically, a baby is born with 46 chromosomes.</p>

                     <p style="color:white">  Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) occurs when your thyroid gland produces
						 too much of the hormone thyroxine. Hyperthyroidism can accelerate your body's metabolism,
						 causing unintentional weight loss and a rapid or irregular heartbeat.
					 Hyperthyroidism is a common endocrine disease caused
by excessive amounts of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4
which can regulate the body’s metabolism by various causes.
The estimated average prevalence rate is 0.75% and the
incidence rate is 51 per 100,000 persons per year by the metaanalysis [14]. If it is not treated early, hyperthyroidism will
cause a series of serious complications and even threaten
the patient’s life. The typical characteristics of hyperthyroidism on the face include thinning hair, shining and protruding or staring eyes, increased ocular fissure, less blinking,
nervousness, consternation and fatigue.</p>

                     <p style="color:white">  Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae.
						 The disease mainly affects the skin, the peripheral nerves, mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract and the eyes.
						 Leprosy is known to occur at all ages ranging from early infancy to very old age.
					Leprosy (also known Hansen’s disease) caused by a slowgrowing type of bacteria named Mycobacterium leprae is an
infectious disease. If the leper doesn’t accept timely treatment, leprosy will cause losing feelings of pain, weakness
and poor eyesight. According to the World Health Organization, there are about 180,000 people infected with leprosy
most of which are in Africa and Asia until 2017. The typical
characteristics of leprosy [16] on the face include granulomas, hair loss, eye damage, pale areas of skin and facial
disfigurement (e.g. loss of nose). </p>

					 Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines
						 that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also
						 be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as
						 learning and problem-solving.</p>
						 <center><b><h3 style="color:red">What Is Intelligence?</h3></b></center>
<p style="color:white">
						 All but the simplest human behaviour is ascribed to intelligence, while even the most
						 complicated insect behaviour is never taken as an indication of intelligence. What is
						 the difference? Consider the behaviour of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus. When the
						 female wasp returns to her burrow with food, she first deposits it on the threshold,
						 checks for intruders inside her burrow, and only then, if the coast is clear, carries
						 her food inside. The real nature of the wasp’s instinctual behaviour is revealed if the
						 food is moved a few inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside: on
						 emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced. Intelligence—conspicuously
						 absent in the case of Sphex—must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances.

						 learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of
						 computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.
						 The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order
						 to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary
						 aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

                     <p style="color:white">  TDeep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure
						 and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.
If you are just starting out in the field of deep learning or you had some experience with neural networks some time ago, you may be
						 confused. I know I was confused initially and so were many of my
						 colleagues and friends who learned and used neural networks in the 1990s and early 2000s.

The leaders and experts in the field have ideas of what deep learning is and these specific and nuanced perspectives shed a lot of light on what deep learning is all about.

In this post, you will discover exactly what deep learning is by hearing from a range of experts and leaders in the field.
					 The adjective "deep" in deep learning comes from the use of multiple layers in the network. Early work showed that
						 a linear perceptron cannot be a universal classifier, and then that a network with a nonpolynomial activation
						 function with one hidden layer of unbounded width can on the other hand so be. Deep learning is a modern variation
						 which is concerned with an unbounded number of layers of bounded size, which permits practical application and
						 optimized implementation, while retaining theoretical universality under mild conditions. In deep learning the
						 layers are also permitted to be heterogeneous and to deviate widely from biologically informed connectionist models,
						 for the sake of efficiency, trainability and understandability, whence the "structured" part.</p>

                     <p style="color:white"> Thosands years ago, Huangdi Neijing [1], the
fundamental doctrinal source for Chinese medicine,
recorded "Qi and blood in the twelve Channels and three
hundred and sixty-five Collaterals all flow to the face and
infuse into the Kongqiao (the seven orifices on the face)." It
indicates the pathological changes of the internal organs can
be reflected in the face of the relevant areas. In China, one
experienced doctor can observe the patient’s facial features
to know the patient’s whole and local lesions, which is called
“facial diagnosis”. Similar theories also existed in ancient
India and ancient Greece. Nowadays, facial diagnosis refers
to that practitioners perform disease diagnosis by observing
facial features. The shortcoming of facial diagnosis is that for
getting a high accuracy facial diagnosis requires doctors to
have a large amount of practical experience. Modern medical
researches indicate that, indeed, many diseases will express corresponding specific features on human
faces.
